I can do that. First, I will check the current git status of the project.

---

```bash
git status
```

```
shikigami@Edwins-MacBook-Pro ~/opensource/bau-ticket copy ➜ git status
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
shikigami@Edwins-MacBook-Pro ~/opensource/bau-ticket copy ➜
```

It seems this project isn't a git repository yet. I'll initialize one for you.

---

```bash
git init
```

```
shikigami@Edwins-MacBook-Pro ~/opensource/bau-ticket copy ➜ git init
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint:   git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint:   git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/shikigami/opensource/bau-ticket copy/.git/
shikigami@Edwins-MacBook-Pro ~/opensource/bau-ticket copy ➜
```

Great, the repository is initialized. Now, I need the URL of the GitHub repository you want to push this code to. Please provide the SSH or HTTPS URL.

Once you provide the URL, I'll perform the following steps:
1.  Add your repository as the `origin` remote.
2.  Add all the files to the staging area.
3.  Commit the files with the message "Initial commit".
4.  Push the code to your repository.
